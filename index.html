                    <p>I am an owner and operator of Roff Roofing & Renovations, LLC. We have been in business for 7 years as an LLC and have already made it very clear that we are different from our competition. In those 7 years we have rose to be one of the top roofing contractors in the state of New Jersey. I do not mean this in a subjective way; we are actually listed as one of the highest rated roofers in a 100 mile radius from our zip code.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.atlasroofing.com/find-a-contractor">Here is the source for that statement.</a>
                    <p>Use zip code 07840.</p>
                    <p>My accolades include years of proven experience in fields like team management and training as well as asset management and resource allocation. I have only left positive impacts on every business I have worked with through the years, which includes dozens of construction companies who were in need of guidance in an ever-changing world dominated by technology.</p>
                    <!-- <p>I have had many people over the years question my knowledge and experience because of my age but I have always used this as my counter-argument: My experience at my age is, in fact, my strength and not my weakness. When you combine my time in the industry with the impacts that I have made it can only mean one thing. I am the real McCoy. Some people take a lifetime to make the sort of impacts I have made and I do not take that for granted. However, I am also accutely aware that as big as my head may be, I still have plenty to learn and grow from and I am fully prepared to face these challenges every single day. For it is these very challenges, whether expected or not, that have made me who I am. And that is what has led me down the road of web development in the first place.</p> -->
